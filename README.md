## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Using the Intel MAX-10 FPGA, interfaced with a distance sensor and buzzer, design a target sensor. When a target is closer than 20 cm, the display should flash at an increasing rate as it is brought closer. The 10 board LEDs should also get brighter and the buzzer should buzz at a higher frequency as a target becomes closer in general.
