## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Using the Intel MAX-10 FPGA, interfaced with a distance sensor and buzzer, design a target sensor. When a target is closer than 20 cm, the display should flash at an increasing rate as it is brought closer. The 10 board LEDs should also get brighter and the buzzer should buzz at a higher frequency as a target becomes closer in general. The system should also allow the user to to display the distance, voltage reading, or ADC moving average as a function of the targetâ€™s location (formatting included). In addition, there should be a RESET button and a HOLD button, which allows the user to hold the display value, with debounce effects filtered out.

### Project Objective

1.	To gain experience with digital systems design, testing, and implementation.
2.	To introduce students to real-world FPGA applications, such as a target sensor.
3.	To give students a glimpse of what it means to be an engineer.
